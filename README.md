  Testing out Github. 
  About me: 
            My name is Yasser and I am 38 years old. Learnt how to program in C++, Visual Basic and Pascal when I
            was 17 years old. Got a Diploma and Advanced National Diploma in Programming. Went to University to
            study Computer Science and realised I hated it. I only wanted to do programming and nothing else, I 
            aced all my programming assignments. I remember getting the highest marks in my Java assignments. 
            
            But life had other plans, I currently manage a MOT Station and am a MOT Inspector. But I still love 
            to program, A few months ago I taught myself how to use Bootstrap to design a website, I didn't even
            realise what bootstrap was until I reversed engineered a website whose response design I loved. 
            
            I designed a full website modifiying the code base of an existing website to match my exact needs.
            But modifying can only get you so far, so I decided to use google and find out exactly what I was
            doing. A week later I was coding the same website from scratch using Bootstrap 5. 
            
            In the process I remembered my love for coding and solving problems when things didn't work. Now I 
            am teaching myself how to code once again, so that my love for the words "Trial & Error" can finally
            return.
